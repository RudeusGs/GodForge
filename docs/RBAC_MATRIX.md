## Rules

- All API and worker-triggering commands re-check server-side permission.
- Removing a member must set `RemovedAt`; repository lookups must ignore removed memberships.
- Hosted Git permission synchronization uses outbox events and is required before production enablement.
- Webhooks authenticate with provider signatures, not user JWT.
